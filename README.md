This is the basic example of how to make a uitableview with navigation-controller. Listing of items, Movings of cells, Editing of ecords, Adding of items, Saving data in plist file when application enter in background. Get data from plist file at the time of loading.
You can press Home buttom is ios simluator to check how the applicationdidEnterBackground works. When application enter in background then data is saving in plist file for further using.
This is the basic concept to teach you so fast that how view pass data with segues to another views.

Really interesting and it is like a complete basic application.

I would like to hear from visitors.
